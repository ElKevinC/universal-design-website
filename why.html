                    Accessibility is essential to all people, even regardless of your capabilities. In the digital world, it is essential to ensure that we all are capable of accessing such technologies. The U.S. is a great country of development, but we also have lots of issues to work on. Just about 12.8% of the population will have a sort of disability preventing them from accessing these technologies. Many other statistics(later shown) will illustrate how much we need to emphasize on technological accessibility.

                As we approach these new technologies, we have to ensure we can promote better experiences, equity and access regardless of ability. We will have to understand the tools and mechanisms needed to apply such technologies. We can say that many, such as students and people with disabilities could always benefit from new formats and styles within these accessibility ideas. These tools could prove very beneficial to organization, navigation and usability.
